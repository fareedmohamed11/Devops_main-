## **Django Application with Docker,AWS , and Jenkins CI/CD**

## **Overview**

This repository showcases a comprehensive DevOps project designed to deploy a Django application using a range of modern tools and practices. The project integrates several technologies to achieve a robust, scalable, and automated deployment pipeline.

### **Project Components**

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the application. Django provides a clean, pragmatic design and a robust set of features for web development.

- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the Django application. The Docker setup includes single and multi-stage builds to ensure efficient and secure image creation.

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized application. Kubernetes provides automated container orchestration, ensuring the application is resilient and scalable.

- **Jenkins**: Implements Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Jenkins pipelines integrate with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to streamline development and deployment workflows.
